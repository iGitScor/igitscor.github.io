### Context

At 1001pharmacies, technical projects are developed using Agile method, more specifically Scrum method.

I was "only" a developer in the scrum team but recently I became the Scrum Master for all those projects.

Here are my work cases...

### What is Scrum

Scrum is a subset of Agile. It is a lightweight process framework for agile development, and the most widely-used one.
- A “process framework” is a particular set of practices that must be followed in order for a process to be consistent with the framework. (For example, the Scrum process framework requires the use of development cycles called Sprints, the XP framework requires pair programming, and so forth.)
- “Lightweight” means that the overhead of the process is kept as small as possible, to maximize the amount of productive time available for getting useful work done.

### Scrum master

The Scrum Master is a facilitator, a person dedicated to the well development of team and product delivery.

### Retrospective

One of the major work for a Scrum master is to make great retrospective to keep a good dynamic and make the team growing and being better !

Here are some formats I used for retrospective:

- [Pig or chicken](retrospective/pig-or-chicken.html)
- [Love retro](retrospective/love-retro.html)
