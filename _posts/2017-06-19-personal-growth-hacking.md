My Dear America,
![American dream](/assets/images/america.svg){: height="96px" width="96px" .pull-right}

I'm not living in your country, but I'd really want to. And I hope that the following article won't hurt you…

On March, the 17th, I mentioned on Twitter, [my blog](http://iscor.me/blog/from-montpellier-to-san-francisco), Github,… everywhere I could, that I was in America, especially in San Francisco. I did that for two main reasons.
{: .clearfix}

## I have a dream

Since I was young (younger, I'm still young!), I'm dreaming of living in the U.S.A., even if the country does not look as beautiful as the American dream itself. But I'm convinced that realizing some dreams make life more beautiful. Travel is such a so wonderful way of living that I must try my best to achieve it.

The problem is that the required conditions to work in America, for a stranger, are hard. Too hard. In an era of free trade, freedom, globalization, we lose one of the great strength of humanity: **sharing**{: .text-success}.

>
    My dear America, call me a cynic if you wish.
    But I know your lies.
    You know them too, my dear America,
    Though you refuse to admit them.
{: .post-blockquote}

**Why cannot we go freely into other countries, especially when we are willing to work in this country?**{: .text-success} That makes me sad.

## I am an engineer

The second reason that makes me want to be part of the tech industry in the USA, is that I believe we would both benefit from it. &ldquo;Trust me, I'm an engineer&rdquo;. I know that some international companies are very well perceived worldwide (or almost) and being recruited by one of them is like grabbing [the golden ticket](https://www.instagram.com/p/BQLyK9ODnTs/). Of course, I'm talking about _GAFAM_ (Google, Apple, Facebook, Amazon, Microsoft) and PayPal, Airbnb… If we had the fact that one of those companies are settled in the US or were created there you not only win the prize you get the golden ticket. To me, a job in a GAFAM company within the US would be one of my greatest professional accomplishment. My  current goal is to be hired by a good tech company in the US not only to make one of my dream come true but to prove to you and myself that I have the abilities, the motivation and the talent to be one of your greatest asset.

And that's how my **growth hacking** experience started.

### Growth hacker and the imposter syndrome

I remember that Todd Motto [talk about the imposter syndrome](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oO0b7iplgYY) after his experience to be promoted expert in Angular.

This is exactly the same experience I encountered. By specifying my new location, and sometimes my new company - Apple through a draw, I've got the same result, to a lesser extent.

I also [wrote an article](http://iscor.me/blog/smashing-conf-san-francisco) about a great topic: **web performance**. I didn't attend the conference in person but I followed the online presentation, thanks to the excellent work of [Smashing Magazine](https://www.smashingmagazine.com), allowing me to thank Patty Toland for her talk.

Some companies, or maybe bots, sent me job opportunities. Those weren't qualified according to my skills so I didn't applied, but living in the American soil is one of the key factors in finding a job, a ~~great~~ help when we are strangers.

Some real people, or maybe bots, began following me on social networks, surely because they appreciated my works, or my French Tech spirit… or certainly because I was working for Apple. They believed that. I especially hope that if I really work for one of these companies, one day, I'll be followed not for the job grade but for research content, debates and discussions.

### Personal growth hacking

Growth hacking is a set of techniques to do cheap marketing. Cheap but effective and qualitative.

> Growth hacking is a process of rapid experimentation across marketing channels and product development to identify the most effective, efficient ways to grow a business. Growth hacking refers to a set of both conventional and unconventional marketing experiments that lead to growth of a business.
{: .post-blockquote}

So, personal growth hacking is the process of experimentation to grow a personal community. And simply change his biography is a cheap and good way to reach other communities.

Indeed, I've reached Meteor San Francisco groups, CEO's and bots, I was added to lists, but the quality was not there. I didn't go thoroughly in the process of growth hacking, however by regularly feeding the machine, who knows, maybe I could already have realized my American dream.

## Hope before reality

By this article, I do not apply for permission to work on your soil.
