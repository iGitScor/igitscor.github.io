## Objective California

Fascinated since my childhood by the USA, more particularly the big cities, I am finally able to realize my project and to embark for months towards the work destination of my dreams. San Francisco, here I am !

## Hello "San Francisco"

I arrived to San Francisco at the beginning of the evening. By the way, I have't landed in an unknown place because I've travelled in California in 2013. But I was always surprised by the jungle of skyscraper, the crowded streets.

## Where I come

I'm a french guy and I come from Montpellier.

<p>
Montpellier is a city in southern France. It is the capital of the Languedoc-Roussillon region, as well as the HÃ©rault department. Montpellier is the 8th largest city of France, and is also the fastest growing city in the country over the past 25 years. Nearly one third of the population is students from 3 universities and 3 higher education institutions that are outside the university framework in the city. Located on the south coast of France on the Mediterranean Sea, it is the third-largest French city on the Mediterranean coast after Marseille and Nice.

## Project

Why am I here in California ?

I've decided to come here in the United States to follow my dreams and also to work in the web domain. As you can see in my <a href="/about.html">bio page</a>, I am a frontend developer specialized in the JavaScript language.
